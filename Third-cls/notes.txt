                              File System modules
                        =================================

command line arguments:
------------------------
     --> you can receive inputs from a user via command line arguments in nodejs application.

     --> arguments are data or value that are passed to your nodejs application via command prompt...

     --> process.argv property returns an array containing arguments passed by user...

yargs:
-------

==> yargs helps to build interactive command line tools, by passing arguments and generating an elegant interface.

file system module:
==================
 
 ==> file system is a method of organizing and retrieving files from a storage medium, such as hard drive.

 ==> the nodejs file system module allows you to work with the file system in your computer...

 ==> to include file system module in your application, use the require () method ..

 ==> every method in the file System has synchronous and asynchronous form...

 synchronous form:
 ==================
     
     ==> it blocks the execution of next line in program and waits till the task associated with file is completed... 

     ==> it uses sync keyword.

     ==> least preferred due to blocking.

Asynchronous:
==============

==> it does't block the execution of program and executes the program without waiting for the completion of task

    associated with the file.

==> it uses the callback function.

==> most preferred way due to non-blocking.

   they are several file system operations are there :

      1. open    2. get  3. write    4. read  5. append    6. rename   7. delete

open file :
===========
             --> it is used to open any existing file...

               syntax:
                             fs.open(path, flags, mode, callback)
get file :
===========

==> it is used to get the information related to the file.

       syntax:
                  fs.stat('file path'. callback)

write file:
==========
               ==> it is ued to write the data into specific file...

                syntax:

                     fs.writeFile("filename",(callback))

Read file:
==========

==> this method uses a file descriptor to read the file. it is used to read the data in to the specific file...

    syntax:
              fs.readFile("fileName",(callback));

Rename file:
=============

==> it is used when you want to change the file name....

     syntax:
              fs.rename(fileName, newName, (callback))

Append file:
============
           ==> it isd used to add new data to the file while maintaining the previous data...

            syntax:

                 fs.appendFile(fileName, (add data to the file), (callback))
