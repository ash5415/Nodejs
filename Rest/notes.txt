                                  REST API'S
                            ========================

==> APi (application program interface) are the access point of the application to communicate with other 

   application in a agreed way....

==> REST (representational state transfer) is a API that allows you to access or manipulate the resource using

    a set of predefined operations  through http protocol methods...

==> REst applications are used in most of the applications as the request bases on the universal HTTP protocol......

    and returns the data in JSON format which most of the programming languages...

Representational state transfer:
================================

==> it means that we can work on the representation of the data....

   example:
   ========
              --> the data stored on the data base but with the help of REST API's we can fetch, update amd delete

                  the data through your application in your server.....

State transfer:
===============

==> it means that the state has been transfer from server to client as the server does not stored any state

    about the client session.....

example:
         ==> a request must contain all the details required to process the request, the server just process the

             request and return the results but it does not store any state of the client session.......

HTTP methods:
=============

              Create  : post 

              Read    : Get
               
              Update  : Update
  
              Delete  : Delete


==> using postman application for testing the APi

==> postman is a application for testing API's by sending request to the web server and getting the response

    back.....

==> it goal is to test out REST API without client....

==> provide collection API'S

==> allow use to give header, body and many more of the API excepts and check the response....
