                                       testing
                                    =============

Automated testing:
==================

==> Automated testing is the technique used to test and compare the actual outcome with the excepted outcome, 

    where new information is continuously fed back into the process...

    Benefits:
    =========

          ==> reduce the maintenance cost...

          ==> improve accuracy....

          ==> increase speed of test execution....

          ==> write the test case once and run as many times you want....

          ==> minimise the human interaction with testing.....

          ==> save time and money....

there are 3 types of testing 

         1. unit testing 

         2. functional testing

         3.integration testing  

unit testing:
=============

==> unit testing is used to tes the small pieces of independent code, unconcerned with how those codes are 

    wrapped into your application.....

==> your code cannot contain external resources like network or databases.....

==> used to prevent regression   (bugs that occurs repeatedly)

==> easy to pinpoint and then fix the problem...

==> if it takes longer time to execute, it is likely that the code under test is much more complex than it should

    be ....

==> popular tool for unit testing include mocha.....


function testing:
===================

==> functional testing are made against combination of many units....

==> you can use many number of external objects or systems like databases, ui, security and other application

    layers...

==> take longer time to execute than unit test.....

==> functionality change represents major releases whereas unit test represents only minor changes, due to which

    they are excepted to change less often than unit test...

==> where user enter username and password and click on send, that user will be logged in. we can easily see 

    that this functional group will comprise of many unit tests, one for validating username, one for handling

    a button click and so on.....

integration testing:
====================

==> integration testing ensures that the entire system application is working correctly.....

==> it can be executed only with in a realistic environment like a real databases, servers, and other systems

    which is like target production environment.....

==> it is used incase you need to test separate systems like databases and application...

==> it is slower than other tests as it is complex to write....

==> the global accessible console.log is commonly used for testing and debugging...

==> it provides a quick way to see what is happening at same point in a script.....

mocha:
=======

==> mocha is the javascript frame work test runner that runs on nodejs as well as browser. it does not concern itself

    with test assertions themselves....
    
        syntax:     npm i mocha -g

==> mocha uses 'describe' and 'it' operators to organize and run your test..

==> mocha is used to run sync as well as async code....

chai:
=====

==> chai is a BDD and  TDD assertions library for node and the browser, offering assertion styles
     
           except, should and assert..

BDD:   (behavior driven development)
==== 

==> this is mostly depends on the end user and quality team...

==> designing application from en user stand point....

==> more focus on the functionality.....

TDD:    (test driven development)
====

==> it is a development practice more close to the developer....

==> the development is done to satisfy the test cases...

==> close to the developer stand point ....
