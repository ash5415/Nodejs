                               Integration with mongodb and email servers
                            =================================================
Data base:
===========

==> data base is a store,organize and manage large amounts of data on a single platform....

==> promote a disciplined approach to data management.....

==> facilitate a well-planned for data analysis....

==> it is a best solution to manage security, multiuse access control,backup and recovery.....

==> data base is a organized collection of data or information so that it can be easily accessed,updated or 

    manipulated....

==> DBMS is a simple software system that is used to define, update, retrieve and manage data in a data base...

==> the majorly used DBMS are relational data base management system and NOsql data base management system...

==> example of some of the DBMS management software are microsoft access,MySQL, oracle, mongodb etc.....

        data is classified in to 2 types 

          1. structured data        2. non structured data 

structured data:
================

==> structured data which os stored in the form of rows and columns.....

==> data is store in the tables using the rows and columns.....

==> SQL : structured query language...

==> sql data bases:

       example: MySQL, MS SQL server, DB2,mariaDB, postgreSQL etc........

==> as the size of the data grows, the performance of these data bases goes down.

==> you can create the relation between the tables
   
example:

                  Roll No  |   Name      |    Class     |     City
            -------------------------------------------------------------
                   1       |   Ashok     |      9       |      guntur

                   2       |   Ash       |      8       |      melbourne

                   3       |  prasad     |     10       |      sydney

Non-structured data:
====================

==> data stored in the form of key value pairs....

==> No SQL data base

example:
          MongoDb, Radis, couch db etc.....



        {
            "rollno" : 1,

            "name"   :ashok,

            "class"  " 12
          },
        {
            "rollno" : 2,

            "name"   :ash,

            "class"  " 10
        }

CRUD operations in MongoDb:
===========================

          C ==> create    command:   db.collection.insert()
          R ==> Read      command:   db.collection.find()
          U ==> update    command:   db.collection.update()
          D ==> delete    command:    db.collection.remove()

==> to use or create any database use "use <database name>"
