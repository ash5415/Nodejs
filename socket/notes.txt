                                    ===============

Half-duplex communication:
==========================

==> Http is the protocol which allows communication between client and  the server .....

==>it supports half-duplex communication, means it allows only one direction flow of traffic at a time....

==> hence the client sends the request to the server (one direction) then the server responds back to the

    client.....

web Socket:
===========

==> Half duplex communication setup-http protocol is not suitable for chat application....

==> this drawback is overcome by the web-Socket protocol which permits full-duplex communication....

==> full-duplex communication means both client and server can communicate and exchange the data at the same 

    time......

==> web Socket sets persistent connection between client and the server......

    example:
              what's up,  sports application, stock application etc.......

==> socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between client 

    and server...

==> it supports wide range of web browsers include old crufty browsers....

==> it consists of a nodejs server and a javascript client library for browser....

    package:                npm install socket.io
